# Pipex
This project will let you discover in detail a UNIX mechanism that you already know by using it in your program.

   1) fork ()
   2) connect pipes
   3) look up the command
   4) do redirections
   5) execve ()
   6) If the execve failed, see if the file has executable mode set.
   If so, and it isn't a directory, then execute its contents as
   a shell script.
